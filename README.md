## Complete Story
<details>
<summary>The dream of the gym</summary>
 
>  Jason was working out hard at the gym. His goal was to become super strong and have a body full of muscles. To achieve this, he made a detailed workout plan. However, because he had trained for too long the day before, he suddenly felt extremely tired today—his body was fatigued, and he even felt a bit dizzy. So, he decided to take a short rest.

> But unexpectedly, he transformed into a small, blue, cartoon character! That’s when he realized—was he trapped in a dream?

> Suddenly, a mischievous-looking little figure appeared and told him he had to complete a parkour level using the arrow keys to move. Only then could he wake up. Jason quickly understood that he had to finish the level fast, or people at the gym might think he had died.

> He passed the level and reached the end successfully. Just as he was relieved and thought he had barely survived the first challenge, he didn’t wake up as he had hoped. Instead, he felt his body becoming more and more tingly—then realized he had turned into a little dinosaur!

> “When will I finally get out of here?” he thought.

> Just then, that evil smile appeared once more. This time, the task was to defeat all the monsters before reaching the goal. He had to use the arrow keys and the space bar to attack. He completed the level again, and his mood lifted—he thought, “This time I’ll really be able to get out!”

> But then, a tattooed, fierce-looking man appeared and said, “I give you my full respect. You passed the two trials I prepared for you. But now, you must defeat me to wake up.”

> Jason was no longer surprised. After being tricked twice, he was curious what his new form would be. This time, he had turned into a knight. “If I’m a knight,” he thought, “then I’m meant to defeat the final boss!”

> When he defeated the boss, the screen suddenly lit up and played a video left by the boss himself—he knew he would be defeated eventually. The video showed the boss in agony.

After watching the video, Jason laughed uncontrollably. Not only had he beaten the final boss, but he could finally return to reality.

> Looking back at all the terrifying things he had experienced, Jason was still in disbelief. But at the same time, he actually enjoyed being a knight and defeating the demon lord. Now, back in the real world, he continued his workout plan once more.

## 完整故事
<details>
<summary>健身房之夢</summary>

> Jason正在健身房努力鍛鍊，他的目標是變得非常強壯，擁有一副充滿肌肉的身體。為了達成這個目標，他制定了一套詳細的健身計畫，然而，由於前一天鍛鍊得太久，他今天突然感到極度疲憊——全身無力，甚至有點頭暈，所以，他決定稍微休息一下。

> 但沒想到，他竟然變成了一個藍色的小卡通角色！這時他才驚覺——自己是不是被困在夢裡了？

> 突然，一個看起來頑皮又帶點邪惡的小傢伙出現，告訴他必須完成一個跑酷關卡，使用方向鍵來移動，才能從夢中醒來。Jason立刻意識到，他必須盡快完成這個關卡，不然健身房裡的人可能會以為他死了。

> 他成功通過了這個關卡，順利抵達終點。就在他鬆了一口氣，以為自己總算撐過了第一道挑戰時，他卻並沒有如願醒來。反而，他感覺自己的身體越來越刺癢——然後他發現自己竟然變成了一隻小恐龍！

> 「我到底什麼時候才能離開這裡啊？」他心想。

> 就在這時，那張邪惡的笑容又再次出現。這一次，他的任務是要在到達終點之前擊敗所有的怪物。他必須使用方向鍵和空白鍵來進行攻擊。他再次順利通關，心情也頓時開朗起來——他想：「這次我真的可以出去了吧！」

> 沒想到，一個全身刺青、面容兇狠的男人出現了，對他說：「我給你滿滿的尊重，畢竟你通過了我為你設下的兩道考驗。但現在，你必須擊敗我，才能真正從夢中醒來。」

> 這次傑森已經不再驚訝。被騙了兩次之後，他反而開始好奇，這次自己會變成什麼模樣。結果，他變成了一位騎士。「既然我成了騎士，」他心想，「那我就該打敗魔王！」

> 當他成功打敗魔王時，螢幕突然亮起，播出了一段魔王留下的影片——因為魔王知道自己終究會被打敗。影片中展示了魔王痛苦的神情。

> 看完整段影片後，傑森忍不住大笑。他不僅打敗了最終魔王，也終於可以回到現實世界了。

> 回想起一路上經歷的種種驚險與恐怖，傑森依然感到不可思議。但同時，他其實也挺享受當騎士、挑戰魔王的過程。而現在，回到現實的他，又重新開始了自己的健身計畫。
